[This question][1] has [nerd-sniped][2] me hard, so I'm on a magical journey to
figuring out how to turn a drawn raster image into Box2D objects.

Not done yet.

This expects your input file to be `input.png` in this project root directory.
Run `make` to do what steps I've got so far.

Dependencies:

 - Node.js and npm
 - Inkscape
 - potrace
 - ImageMagick (`convert` and `mogrify`)
